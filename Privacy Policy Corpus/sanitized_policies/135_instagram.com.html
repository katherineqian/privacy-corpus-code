<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">|||We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core features of the app that you've come to know and love.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.
